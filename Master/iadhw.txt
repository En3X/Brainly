Make a page called addbalance
    - user inputs amount
    - when submit btn is clicked, newblance = oldbalance + userinput
    - oldbalance = database balance (auth.user.balance)
    - calculated new balance is updated on database
        . user.update(name), user.update(balance)

When making purchase
    - Check if user has enough balance i.e. balance >= purchasing amount
        - if yes
            - balance update in database, i.e. newbalance = balance - purchasing amount
            - purchase log update with new value
                - id, product_id, user_id, amount
            - Purchase successful
        - if no
            - Purchase failed, you do not have enough balance
